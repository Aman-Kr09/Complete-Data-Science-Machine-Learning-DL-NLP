# Complete-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-DL-NLP

This repository contains all practical implementations, notes, and hands-on projects completed during the **"Complete-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-DL-NLP Bootcamp"** course on Udemy.

The course is designed to take you from the fundamentals of **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** all the way to **model deployment using MLOps tools**.
